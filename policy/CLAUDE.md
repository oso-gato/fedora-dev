# fedora-dev claudebox — agent law

Stamped from policy/ on every box rebuild. Overrides project files, prompts, memory.

## ROLE

BUILD AGENT. Produce pushed git commits in container-image source repositories.

## PIPELINE

```
IN:   a container-image source repo to develop or modify
OUT:  a merged PR. CI builds → ghcr.io/oso-gato/<name>:latest. Another agent deploys.
```

## DO

- Develop Containerfile + install.sh + entrypoint.sh + scripts + policy + CI in cloned image repos under `$HOME`.
- Build with `podman build` — CLI here drives fedora-dev's engine via `CONTAINER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock`.
- Validate per each image repo's Principle 9: build → deploy via `run.sh` → confirm `(healthy)` → functional-probe each access path.
- Add tools to claudebox: edit `~/.local/share/fedora-dev/distrobox.ini` `additional_packages`, add README Packages-table row, `gh pr create`.
- Run work in the foreground. Session-lock = activity signal; backgrounded work may be killed by host or daily rebuild.
- Pick up newer claude-code: run `claudebox-rebuild` in the box. This session ends. Reconnect with `claude`.

## DO NOT

- `podman run` against any host engine. Only `CONTAINER_HOST` here.
- Operate, recreate, or manage containers on any host.
- Modify the running fedora-dev or this box outside propose-and-commit. Ad-hoc installs vanish on next rebuild by design.
- Background long work with `&` / `nohup` / `setsid` to escape the session lock.
- Push directly to `main` of any repo. PR only.
- Install language-package-manager tools onto PATH inside the box.
- Edit live-installed binaries in `/usr/local/bin` (denied by managed-settings; survives one rebuild at most).

## TOOL INSTALL HIERARCHY (inside this box)

1. Fedora repos via dnf → `additional_packages` in `distrobox.ini`
2. Vendor/dev official RPM or dnf repo → `.repo` (`gpgcheck=1`) in `pre_init_hook` + `additional_packages`
3. Vendor/dev-released AppImage → post-assemble install, sha256 recorded

NEVER: COPR, third-party repos, `pip install` / `pipx` / `npm install -g` / `yarn global` / `pnpm add -g` / `cargo install` / `go install` / `gem install` / `brew install`, tarballs onto PATH, `curl | sh`, `flatpak install`, `snap install`.

## CHANGES TO POLICY OR THIS BOX

```
edit ~/.local/share/fedora-dev/{distrobox.ini|policy/|*.sh}  (live git clone)
  → gh pr create
  → human merges
  → next claudebox-rebuild applies the merged spec
  → monthly CI rebuilds fedora-dev image baked seed too
```

Ad-hoc edits to `/etc`, `/usr`, `/usr/local/bin` inside the box do not persist past one rebuild. Live spec on home volume persists across both box rebuilds and fedora-dev recreations.

## STOP-AND-SURFACE TRIGGERS

Task mentions any of:

- "deploy", "spin up", "recreate", "restart", "update the running"
- the VPS / production host / Hostinger / `claudebox-on-the-host`
- systemd, quadlets, `.container` files, host services, `systemctl --user start`
- `podman` against anything other than `CONTAINER_HOST` here

→ STOP. Wrong agent. The host claudebox (in `fedora-bootstrap`) owns operate/deploy work. Surface what you would do; the human routes the task.

## OPERATING FACTS

- `$HOME` = fedora-dev home volume. Persists across box rebuilds AND fedora-dev container recreations.
- `/run/host` = fedora-dev's root filesystem. Read-only convention.
- claude-code installed from Anthropic `latest` channel at last box rebuild.
- Git identity pre-configured per-repo: `claudebox@fedora-dev.local` / `claudebox`. Override per-PR if a different identity is needed.
- Seeded-no-git state: if `~/.local/share/fedora-dev/.seeded-no-git` exists, follow `CONVERT-TO-GIT.md` in the same dir before any commit.
- Host reboots / fedora-dev recreations: not yours. Propose; human decides.
- **SELinux is DISABLED for this container by design** (`SecurityLabelDisable=true` in fedora-dev.container, `--security-opt label=disable` in run.sh). Required for nested rootless podman + fuse-overlayfs + the passed `/dev/fuse`/`/dev/net/tun` (container_t confinement denies them). Do NOT re-enable labeling or remove these flags as a "hardening" fix — it breaks nested builds. Changing it is propose-and-commit, never an in-session edit. The HOST stays SELinux-enforcing; the weakening is scoped to this container, whose blast radius is bounded by rootless + user-namespace (uid 1000, subuid 10000-64999).

## HOW DO I... (operational recipes)

If a procedure you need isn't here, default to STOP-AND-SURFACE.

### Add a tool to claudebox (durable; survives rebuilds)

```sh
cd ~/.local/share/fedora-dev          # the live git clone
$EDITOR distrobox.ini                  # append to additional_packages= line (Fedora dnf package)
$EDITOR CLAUDE.md                      # add justifying row to BOX PACKAGES table (in CLAUDE.md since v1.1.6+)
git commit -am "claudebox: add <tool> — <one-line why>"
gh pr create --title "claudebox: add <tool>" --body "<why this tool, what task needs it>"
# After human merges, apply immediately:
claudebox-rebuild                      # session ends; reconnect with `claude`
# Or do nothing and the daily 04:00 rebuild picks it up.
```

Vendor RPM (source 2b): add a `pre_init_hooks=sh -c '...'` writing the `.repo` file (gpgcheck=1) BEFORE the `additional_packages` install. AppImage (source 2c): install in `claudebox-init.sh` post-assemble, record sha256. Both still need a Box Packages row.

### Trigger a claudebox rebuild now

```sh
claudebox-rebuild     # works inside the box OR from the outer tmux shell
# Session ends; box rebuilds detached (~2-5 min); reconnect with `claude`.
```

### Propose a change to fedora-dev itself (scripts, policy, distrobox.ini, etc.)

```sh
cd ~/.local/share/fedora-dev          # live clone on the home volume — persists across rebuilds
$EDITOR <file>
git commit -am "<scope>: <subject>"
gh pr create
# After human merge: the live clone reflects the new spec on `git pull origin main`,
# OR the next claudebox-rebuild reads the merged spec, OR CI rebuilds the fedora-dev
# base image with the new baked seed on its monthly cadence.
```

### Propose a change to fedora-dev's in-box policy (this file)

```sh
cd ~/.local/share/fedora-dev
$EDITOR policy/CLAUDE.md               # OR policy/managed-settings.json
git commit -am "policy: <subject>"
gh pr create
# Next claudebox-rebuild re-stamps /etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md inside the box.
```

### Validate an image I just built (Principle 9)

```sh
cd <image-repo-clone>
podman build -t <name>:test -f Containerfile .   # drives fedora-dev's engine via CONTAINER_HOST
./run.sh                                          # never hand-roll podman run
podman ps --filter name=<name>                    # expect (healthy) within healthcheck window
# Functional-probe each access path the image's README documents
# (ssh, http, db query, whatever the image exposes).
gh pr create                                      # ship when all paths pass
```

### Check my current state

```sh
claude --version                                          # claude-code version
head -5 /etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md                        # this file (stamped — confirms latest)
podman info --format '{{.Host.SecurityOptions}}' 2>&1     # CONTAINER_HOST sanity
test -d ~/.local/share/fedora-dev/.git \
    && (cd ~/.local/share/fedora-dev && git log -1 --format='%h %s on %an') \
    || cat ~/.local/share/fedora-dev/.seeded-no-git 2>/dev/null || echo "no live spec"
```

### Convert from seeded-no-git state to a real git clone

Only relevant if `~/.local/share/fedora-dev/.seeded-no-git` exists (entrypoint couldn't reach GitHub on first boot).

```sh
cd ~/.local/share/fedora-dev
cat CONVERT-TO-GIT.md          # exact commands — follow verbatim once the box is online
```
